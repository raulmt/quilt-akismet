h1. A Tapestry 5 Module for Akismet API compatible services

This is Tapestry 5 IOC Module for interacting with services compatible to the Akismet API (http://akismet.com/development/api/). This includes Akismet itself (http://akismet.com/) as well as the free and open source alternative TypePad AntiSpam (http://antispam.typepad.com/).

This project is strongly based on the work by Michael J. Simons, java-akismet, but modified in order to be simpler in the context of a Tapestry 5 module and to take advantage of this as well.

h2. Deployment

Download the source code and do a Maven install (mvn install). Add the dependency on your project's pom.xml like this:

<pre>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.raulmt</groupId>
		<artifactId>quilt-akismet</artifactId>
		<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
	</dependency>
</pre>

Finally, configure your API Key (you can obtain one for free if you use TypePad AntiSpam here: http://antispam.typepad.com/info/get-api-key.html) and API Consumer (the URL of your site) by contributing the following symbols in your app module:

<pre>
	public void contributeApplicationDefaults(MappedConfiguration<String, String> configuration) {
		configuration.add(AkismetSymbols.API_CONSUMER, "[YOUR SITE URL]");
		configuration.add(AkismetSymbols.API_KEY, "[YOUR API KEY]");
	}
</pre>

There are others symbols to use another service (the default is TypePad AntiSpam) or to specify the exact API endpoint you want to use.

And done!

h2. Usage

Just inject the Akismet service and check your comments! The service's methods receive a AkismetComment object, so you have to create one from your own comment representation.
